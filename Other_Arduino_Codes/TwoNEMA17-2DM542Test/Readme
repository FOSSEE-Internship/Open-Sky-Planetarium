This code is meant to test NEMA 17 motors with 2DM542 (microstep driver). The connections are as under:

1. The pins A+ A- B+ and B- are connected with the four pins of NEMA17. 
2. V+ and GND are connected to 24V power supply terminals. GND is shorted with the GND of Arduino. 
3. ENA- DIR- and PLS- are connected to GND of Arduino.
4. PLS+ --> D10 of Arduino.
5. DIR+ --> D11 of Arduino.
6. ENA+ --> D12 of Arduino. 
7. RS232 pins were completely OFF.
8. The swicthes on the driver were adjusted for 3200 steps per revolution and 1A current supply. 

This code makes the two motors NEMA 17 run only once for 180 degrees (one after another).
